# Project Description
## Problem Statement
Alumni management system is a dedicated solution or software aimed at enabling organizations - 
usually colleges and universities, to be in constant touch with the Alumni. An Alumni (Alumnus) is a 
graduate or former student of a particular school, college, or university. AIMS provide a platform 
for Alumni members to connect among themselves and maintain a close relationship with their 
Alma Mater. Alma Mater is a school, college, or university which one has attended or from which 
one has graduated. Using a reliable Alumni information management software solution, the 
platform can allow Alumni members and other graduates to connect. 

## Problem Breakdown
### Brainstorming
As a team, the first thing to do when working on a project is brainstorm. Below are images that show the first stage of our project management, which is designing.

This drawing shows the front end of the system which basically exposes the user to content such as the gallery, career advice, upcoming events in the institution, news, elections, jobs available and also creation to of an account.

In addition, this is the event planning page that shows the upcoming events taking place at the institution.

# Solution Creation
Our solution is an AMS website, which provides a full platform for alumni to interact and communicate with their alma school. Alumni have access to a user-friendly site where they can log in and explore a variety of options on the front end. This includes updating personal information, staying up to date on forthcoming alumni events and news, interacting with other graduates via a directory, and gaining access to job prospects and professional resources. Our admin panel allows administrators to manage user accounts, manage content, events, and alumni directories. Our products are built with a heavy emphasis on security, scalability, and usability in mind.

# Databases
Sqlite
* We selected SQLite as our database for the Alumni Management System (AMS) website due to its lightweight, serverless, and efficient nature. SQLite's strong performance, data security features, and compatibility with various platforms made it a practical choice for our needs, ensuring a reliable and streamlined data storage solution.
